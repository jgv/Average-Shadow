h1. Average Shadow

p. Average Shadow is a jQuery plugin that generates a box shadow based on the average color of an image that it is applied to. For example:

<br>
!http://jonathanvingiano.com/Average-Shadow/assets/images/red.png! &nbsp; !http://jonathanvingiano.com/Average-Shadow/assets/images/purp.png!

h2. Useage 

p. Average Shadow can only be bound to images. Otherwise it will freak out and your computer will stop working forever sorry... Also, your browser must support the HTML5 @<canvas>@ element and CSS3.

p. Apply it to element on your webpage like so:

<pre>
$('img').avgShadow();
</pre>

p. or with options

<pre>
$('.my-cool-images').avgShadow({ horizontal: 10, vertical: 10, spread: 50 });
</pre>

h3. Options

|_.option|_.description|_.default|
|horizontal|sets the posisition of the horizontal shadow in pixels|0|
|vertical|sets the position of the vertical shadow in pixels|0|
|blur|sets the blur distance in pixels|10|
|spread|sets the size of the shadow in pixels|5|
|inset|uses an inset shadow instead of an outset shadow, a boolean|false|

h3. Run Tests

p. If you want to test Average Shadow you must do so in browser. This is the case because browsers consider getting the data of an image that is served over a local file system to be a security issue.
